# MedianSelection

- This project provides a way to calculate the median of a stream of numbers. 

- It works by maintaining two heaps, a min-heap and a max-heap, which divide the input into two halves. 
The median is then the average of the top elements of each heap.

- It requests data from Alpha Vantage API and uses JfreeChart to draw the chart.
